<h3Early life and education</h3>
<p>
    Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India, into a Sikh family.[3] He lost his mother when he was very young and was raised by his paternal grandmother, to whom he was very close.[citation needed] His early schooling was in the Urdu medium, and even as
     Prime Minister years later, he wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.

After the Partition of India, his family migrated to Amritsar, India, where he studied at Hindu College, Amritsar.[citation needed] He attended Panjab University, then in Hoshiarpur,[4][5][6] Punjab, studying Economics and got his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively, standing first throughout his academic career.

<h3>Political career</h3>
<p>
    In June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, P. V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully the British journalist in 2005 "On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, 
    he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, 'The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance'. I didn't take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, 
    and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that's how I started in politics".[9] 
</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance</h3>
<p>
    In 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 percent of India's GDP.[21] India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1 billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports,[22] in comparison to US$600 billion today</p>
<h3>Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha</h3>
<p>
    Singh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991[27] by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007[3] and 
    2013.[28] From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
